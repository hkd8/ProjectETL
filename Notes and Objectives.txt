Data Cleaning:
1. population_by_zip is 3MB over recommended size for git. Possible cleaning of zips we do not need?
2. Cleaning DataSets to what we need. Only prominent columns would be ZIP, POPULATION, FRANCHISE_NAME, TYPE_OF_FRANCHISE, STATE, CITY (discuss whats needed).

Data Sources:
1. Population data = Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/census/census-bureau-usa
2. Restaurant data = Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/fast-food-restaurants#FastFoodRestaurants.csv

Data Merging:
1. From census --> restaurant; merge on ZIP

MISC:
1. Finding sales data? Not necessarily needed, but extra time if permitting.
2. If sales data can be found, would need a merge based on franchise_name (don't know options yet)
