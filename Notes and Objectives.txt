Data Cleaning:
1. population_by_zip is 3MB over recommended size for git. Possible cleaning of zips we do not need?
2. Cleaning DataSets to what we need. Only prominent columns would be ZIP, POPULATION, FRANCHISE_NAME, TYPE_OF_FRANCHISE, STATE, CITY (discuss whats needed).

Data Sources:
1. Population data = Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/census/census-bureau-usa
2. Restaurant data = Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/fast-food-restaurants#FastFoodRestaurants.csv

Data Merging:
1. From census --> restaurant; merge on ZIP

MISC:
1. Finding sales data? Not necessarily needed, but extra time if permitting.
2. If sales data can be found, would need a merge based on franchise_name (don't know options yet)

EXPERIMENT LOG:
-DataTypes in DFs are different. Restaurant has zipcode type as Object. Population has zipcode type as INT64.
	- Issues from this, restaurant zipcode have zips with '-'. Because of this, the DataType can NOT be converted to INT64.
	- DataType must be a text based due to the dash. I have converted the population DF to an object instead to properly merge.
-Finding a proper way to merge has been the biggest obstacle. I've attempted numerous merges so far; none working.
	- 'pd.merge(cleaned_population, cleaned_restaurant, on='zipcode', how='inner')' = Blank DF? Unknown reason.
-Easier way to merge may be found in MySQL; have not explored those options. 
-Have hashed out setting the index as the zip. May come back to this option if a merging option without is not found.
